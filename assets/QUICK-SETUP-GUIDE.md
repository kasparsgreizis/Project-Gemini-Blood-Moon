# Quick Setup Guide - Adding Visual References

**Fast workflow for dumping visual inspiration into the project**

---

## 🚀 **Quick Start (2-Minute Setup)**

### **Step 1: Drop Your Images**
1. **Drag & drop images** into appropriate folders:
   - `/mood-boards/` - Overall vibe and atmosphere
   - `/lighting/` - Lighting design ideas  
   - `/dj-setups/` - DJ booth and equipment layouts
   - `/rooftop-venues/` - Rooftop space designs
   - `/eclipse-photography/` - Lunar eclipse references
   - `/branding/` - Typography, logos, colors
   - `/sponsor-assets/` - Partner brand materials

### **Step 2: Quick Rename (Optional but Recommended)**
Format: `[category]_[description]_[source]_[date].[ext]`

**Examples:**
- `mood_rooftop-party-night_pinterest_20240902.jpg`
- `lighting_dj-booth-ambient_instagram_20240902.png`
- `eclipse_blood-moon-sequence_nasa_20240902.jpg`

### **Step 3: Update Index (When You Have Time)**
- Open the relevant `index.md` file
- Add a quick entry for your new images
- Save and commit to git

**Done!** AI agents can now analyze your visual references.

## 📱 **Mobile/Quick Workflow**

### **For Quick Inspiration Dumps:**

1. **Screenshot or save image** to your device
2. **AirDrop/sync to computer** into project folder
3. **Quick sort** into appropriate category folder
4. **Batch rename later** when you have time
5. **Document in index.md** when ready for AI analysis

### **Using Cloud Services:**
- **Save to project folder** in iCloud/Dropbox/Google Drive
- **Auto-sync** keeps everything updated
- **Rename and organize** during regular project reviews

## 🤖 **For AI Agent Users**

### **Immediate Analysis Available:**
Once images are in category folders, AI agents can:
- **Analyze aesthetic elements** and extract color palettes
- **Identify design patterns** and recurring themes
- **Generate design recommendations** based on references
- **Cross-reference categories** for consistency

### **Better Analysis with Documentation:**
When `index.md` files are updated, AI agents can:
- **Understand context** and relevance of each reference
- **Follow cross-references** between related materials
- **Respect source attribution** and usage rights
- **Generate more targeted recommendations**

## ⚡ **Power User Tips**

### **Batch Operations:**
- **Select multiple images** and drag to category folder
- **Use bulk rename tools** for consistent naming
- **Create template entries** in index.md for quick copying

### **Source Tracking:**
- **Keep source URLs** in image metadata or index.md
- **Note usage rights** and attribution requirements
- **Save original links** for future reference

### **AI Integration:**
- **High-resolution images** (1920px+ width) for detailed analysis  
- **Consistent naming** helps AI organize and cross-reference
- **Include context** in index.md for better AI understanding

## 🎯 **Priority Order for Building References**

### **Week 1 - Essential Foundation:**
1. **Mood boards** (8-12 images) - Overall aesthetic direction
2. **Eclipse photography** (5-8 images) - Core event inspiration
3. **Rooftop venues** (6-10 images) - Space planning references

### **Week 2 - Technical References:**
4. **DJ setups** (6-8 images) - Equipment and layout planning
5. **Lighting** (8-10 images) - Technical and aesthetic lighting
6. **Sponsor assets** (official brand guidelines as available)

### **Week 3 - Brand Development:**
7. **Branding** (5-8 images) - Typography and identity inspiration
8. **Marketing references** - Event promotion examples
